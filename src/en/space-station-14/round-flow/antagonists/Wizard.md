<!--
`Designers` should be the names that you use on GitHub and/or Discord. This is optional but strongly recommended, since:

- This acknowledges credit where it is due
- People who are confused about the written intent can use this information to contact the authors

`Implemented` is the status of the feature.

Github links can include multiple PRs, if relevant.

## Overview

<!-- A very short, maybe three sentence summary of what this proposal is about. A high level "overview" or "what this adds". -->

This is for The Wizard antagonist - which is to help answer any frequently asked questions for the Wizard and to help 
others understand what the Wizard is about. The Wizard in short is a highly disruptive/chaotic antagonist that does
anything to their whim. A lot about the Wizard is that it doesn't conform to standard rules so it very much is the
embodiment of "a wizard did it." Players will be encouraged to come up with their own gimmick, while still being an
antagonist to the station.

## Background

<!--
Summarize any information that is needed to contextualize the proposed changes, e.g. the current state of the game.

Also link any relevant discussions on Discord, GitHub, or HackMD that are relevant to the proposal.
-->

## Features to be added

<!-- Give a description of what game mechanics you would like to add or change. This should be a general overview, with enough details on critical design points that someone can directly implement the feature from this design document. Exact numbers for game balance however are not necessary, as these can be adjusted later either during development or after it has been implemented, but mention *what* will have to be balanced and what needs to be considered when doing so. -->

## Game Design Rationale

<!--
Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../space-station-14/core-design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?
- What makes this feature enjoyable or rewarding for players?
- Does it introduce meaningful choices, risk vs. reward, or new strategies?
- How does it enhance player cooperation, competition, or emergent gameplay?
- If the feature is a new antagonist, how does it fit into the corresponding [design pillars](../space-station-14/round-flow/antagonists.md)?
-->

## Roundflow & Player interaction

<!--
Consider addressing:
- At what point in the round does the feature come into play? Does it happen every round? How does it affect the round pace?
- How do you wish for players to interact with your feature and how should they not interact with it? How is this mechanically enforced?
- Which department will interact with the feature? How does the feature fit into the [design document](../space-station-14/departments.md) for that department?
-->

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

<!--
- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?
- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?
- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?
-->

# Technical Considerations

<!--
- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
